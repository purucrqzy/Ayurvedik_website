<p>animal order include

    * harmony among these 4 orders
    
    -there is a mutual fulfillment among the first 3 orders 
    the soil-plant interaction is an example of mutual fulfillment between bio order and physical order  
    -like that ANIMAL AND BIRDS depends on plants for their food at the same time animals and birds help to spread seeds of plants from one place to another. they protect plants form harmful insects and paste sides similarly the units of physical order like soil and air water are essential for animal to survive 
    -therefore these 3 orders are interlinked with each other but the fourth order that is human order are not fulfilling any requirements of above orders , rather it dominating and exploiting them
    -interconnect Ness, self regulations and mutual fulfillment among the four orders 
            - with the discussion by above we conclude that there is a interconnects and mutual fulfillment among the orders also we can see there is a self regulations in nature 
            -ex: in a forest the proportion of soil , plants and animals of various species is self regulated. it never happen that the lion eat all the animals or the animals all the grass
    -the forest does not need to be regulated by human being to be in harmony.
    
    - with the right understanding only will also self organize in harmony within 
    realising the exitance as a co-exitence al all the level in this point we explore harmony in existence animal order include
